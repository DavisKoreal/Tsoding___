This is a simple linear regression model using one feature and one label

@approx_function : holds the approximating function that we want to fit into the data
@cost_function_derivative : the derivative of the cost function
@headers : holds the headers that might be needed throughout the project
@main : main function utilization
@model_template : source file for modelling.hpp constructor
@modelling.hpp : class that holds exerything together in the model
@print_cost : function to print cost as the model iterates 
@print_model_data : print the data that we are trying to fit using the approximatuing function
@tests : various tests to ensure that all the modules are working withing specified specifications


Further README's will be an explanation of what the main function of the agent/program does, not a full verbose description of what are its attributes
